I honestly feel I got every penny\u2019s worth.","description2":"\u201c I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I\u2019ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I\u2019ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. \u201d","image":"/images/image-daniel.jpg","dark":true,"bg":"hsl(263, 55%, 52%)","grid":"grid1"},{"id":2,"name":"Jhonatan Walters","subtitle":"Verificed Gradute","description1":"The team was very supportive and kept me motivated","description2":"\u201c I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills.

Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.","description2":"\u201c The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. \u201d","image":"/images/image-patrick.jpg","dark":true,"bg":"hsl(219, 29%, 14%)","grid":"grid4"},{"id":5,"name":"Kira Whitle","subtitle":"Verificed Gradute","description1":"Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!","description2":"\u201c Before joining the bootcamp, I\u2019ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I\u2019ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! \u201d","image":"/images/image-kira.jpg","dark":false,"bg":"hsl(210, 46%, 95%)","grid":"grid5"}]')},20:function(e,n,r){"use strict";r.r(n);var t=r(1),i=(r(0),r(8)),a=r.n(i),o=r(2),d=r(3);function s(){var e=Object(o.a)(["\n*{\n    margin:0;\n    padding:0;\n    box-sizing:border-box;\n}\nbody{\n    font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;\n    font-size:13px;\n}\n"]);return s=function(){return e},e}var c=Object(d.a)(s());function l(){var e=Object(o.a)(["\ndisplay:flex;\nflex-direction:column;\npadding:2rem;\nborder-radius:15px;\nbackground-color:",";\n@media screen and (min-width:1050px){\n    grid-area:",";\n}\n"]);return l=function(){return e},e}function u(){var e=Object(o.a)(["\ndisplay:flex;\nalign-items:center;\n"]);return u=function(){return e},e}var g=d.b.div(u()),m=d.b.div(l(),(function(e){return e.Bg||"auto"}),(function(e){return e.grid})),f="hsl(219, 29%, 14%)",p="hsl(0, 0%, 81%)",h="hsl(210, 46%, 95%)";function b(){var e=Object(o.a)(["\nmax-width:100%;\nborder-radius:50%;\nmargin-right:.5rem;\n"]);return b=function(){return e},e}function j(){var e=Object(o.a)(["\nfont-size:.8rem;\nfont-weight:500;\nopacity: 70%;\n"]);return j=function(){return e},e}function v(){var e=Object(o.a)(["\nmargin:1rem 0;\nfont-size:1rem;\nfont-weight:600;\ncolor:",";\n"]);return v=function(){return e},e}function w(){var e=Object(o.a)(["\nfont-size:1rem;\nfont-weight:500;\ncolor:",";\nopacity: 50%;\n"]);return w=function(){return e},e}function y(){var e=Object(o.a)(["\nfont-size:1.5rem;\nfont-weight:600;\ncolor:",";\n"]);return y=function(){return e},e}var x=d.b.h1(y(),(function(e){return e.dark?f:p})),k=d.b.span(w(),(function(e){return e.dark?f:p})),I=d.b.p(v(),(function(e){return e.dark?h:f})),O=Object(d.b)(I)(j()),T=d.b.img(b()),z=function(e){var n=e.user,r=n.name,i=n.subtitle,a=n.image,o=n.description1,d=n.description2,s=n.dark,c=n.bg,l=n.grid;return Object(t.jsxs)(m,{Bg:c,grid:l,children:[Object(t.jsxs)(g,{children:[Object(t.jsx)(T,{src:"/grid-testimonials-app"+a}),Object(t.jsxs)(x,{dark:s,children:[r,Object(t.jsx)("br",{}),Object(t.jsx)(k,{dark:s,children:i})]})]}),Object(t.jsx)(I,{dark:s,children:o}),Object(t.jsx)(O,{dark:s,children:d})]})};function G(){var e=Object(o.a)(["\ndisplay:grid;\ngrid-template-columns:1fr;\ngap:2rem; \npadding:1rem;\nbackground-color:#14f3ce;\n \n@media screen and (min-width:1050px){\n    height:100vh; \n    padding:2rem;                  \n    grid-template-areas:'grid1 grid1 grid2 grid5'\n                        'grid3 grid4 grid4 grid5';\n    grid-template-columns:300px 1fr 1fr 1fr;\n}\n"]);return G=function(){return e},e}var V=d.b.div(G()),B=r(12),J=function(){return Object(t.jsx)(V,{children:B.map((function(e){return Object(t.jsx)(z,{user:e},e.id)}))})};var S=function(){return Object(t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[Object(t.jsx)(c,{}),Object(t.jsx)(J,{})]})};a.a.render(Object(t.jsx)(S,{}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[20,1,2]]]);
